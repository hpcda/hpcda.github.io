Yuuichi ASAHI received the PhD degree from Tokyo Tech, in 2015. He is a researcher in Japan atomic energy agency (JAEA), Japan. 
He has focused on the nonlinear plasma turbulence by means of gyrokinetic simulations. 
High performance computing and large scale data management are key ingredients for these simulations.
His current interests include accelerating the gyrokinetic simulation codes for more complicated
physics, and analysing the large scale simulation results with machine learning methods.
