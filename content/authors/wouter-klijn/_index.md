Wouter Klijn  completed a MSc  in Artificial  Intelligence from the  University of Groningen  in the
Netherlands. His Master thesis was on the information content  of cell species in a 3 layer model of
a cortical  micro-column. He currently  is a  software architect in  the Simlab Neuroscience  at the
Forschungzentrum JÃ¼lich  with a focus  on in Artificial  Intelligence, information theory  of neural
networks,  big  data  real-time  streaming  systems   and  development  of  complex  HPC  processing
pipelines. He is responsible  for science and use case management in the  Human Brain Project, an EU
Flagship  Project  and  ICEI,  the  Interactive  Computing  E-Infrastructure  for  the  Human  Brain
Project.  He is  currently creating  the science  and software  infrastructure architecture  for the
HBP. He  also works  with advanced  HPC oriented AI  solutions and  multiple neural  simulators. His
modelling work is focused  on self-organizing dynamics of extremely large neural  networks with a 2d
spatial structure.
